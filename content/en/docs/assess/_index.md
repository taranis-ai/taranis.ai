Detail view: 
* Relevance of item/aggregate can be changed with "up/down" buttons 

Charts: 
* Each item displays a chart if data has been aggregated in the last 7 days. 
* Line and bar chart display the same data, which is the accumulation of items per day.
* The y-axis of the line chart can be adapted and is the same for all charts in the current items list. Therefore, charts can be compared properly.
