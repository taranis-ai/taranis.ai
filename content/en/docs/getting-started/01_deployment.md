weight: 1
---

Install from [`stable` release](https://github.com/taranis-ai/taranis-ai/releases/latest)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://taranis.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Clone via git

```bash
git clone --depth 1  https://github.com/taranis-ai/taranis-ai
cd taranis-ai/docker/
```

## Configuration

Copy `env.sample` to `.env`

```bash
cp env.sample .env
```

Open `.env` and change the defaults before exposing the instance on a network. More details about environment variables can be found in the [docker README](https://github.com/taranis-ai/taranis-ai/blob/master/docker/README.md).

### Redis and worker queues

Taranis AI uses Redis and RQ for worker queues, scheduled jobs, and frontend cache storage.

| Variable | Used by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `REDIS_URL` | core, frontend, workers | Redis connection URL for RQ queues and cache fallback. |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | core, frontend, workers | Redis password. Set this in production. |
| `CACHE_REDIS_URL` | core, frontend | Optional dedicated Redis URL for frontend cache and cache invalidation. Falls back to `REDIS_URL`. |
| `CACHE_REDIS_PASSWORD` | core, frontend | Optional dedicated cache Redis password. Falls back to `REDIS_PASSWORD`. |
| `RQ_DEFAULT_JOB_TIMEOUT` | core | Default RQ job timeout in seconds for queued worker tasks. Default: `180`. |

The Compose deployment wires Redis into `core`, `frontend`, `collector`, `cron`, and `workers`. If queued jobs are accepted but not processed, verify that Redis is reachable and at least one worker container is running.

See [Background Jobs](/docs/getting-started/07_background-jobs/) for Redis/RQ architecture, health checks, scheduled jobs, and upgrade notes.

### LLM bot settings

The Compose deployment includes the optional `llm-bot` service for LLM-backed summaries, title generation, NER, clustering, and sentiment.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `BOT_API_KEY` | Shared secret used by workers when calling bot services. |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | Base URL of the upstream OpenAI-compatible API. |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | Upstream API key. |
| `LLM_MODEL` | Model name, unless the upstream provides a default. |
| `LLM_TIMEOUT` | Upstream request timeout in seconds. |
| `LLM_BOT_PORT` | Internal `llm-bot` port, default `8000`. |

See [LLM Bot Service](/docs/getting-started/08_llm-bot/) for endpoint mapping and bot configuration.

### Images and tags

Taranis AI images are tagged as follows:

- Official release version number (e.g. `1.1.7`)
- Every official image release comes with an extra stable tag, in case pinning the release is not favourable (`stable`)
- Latest tag for tracking the latest uploaded image, there is no guarantee this is an officially released image (`latest`)

See [Internal TLS Configuration](/docs/getting-started/20_tls-configuration) for setting up TLS encryption and [Advanced monitoring](/docs/getting-started/15_advanced-monitoring) for more logging insights.
For detailed information about container tags, release strategy, and deployment recommendations, see [Releases and Container Tags](/docs/getting-started/05_releases-and-tags).

## Startup & Usage

Pull the configured release images before starting or upgrading:

```bash
docker compose pull
```

Start the application:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Verify readiness:

```bash
curl -fsS http://<url>:<TARANIS_PORT>/api/health
docker compose ps
```

Use the application:

```bash
http://<url>:<TARANIS_PORT>/login
```

## Initial Setup

**The default credentials are `user` / `user` and `admin` / `admin`. Change them before production use.**

The passwords for these two default users can be overridden by setting the environment variables `PRE_SEED_PASSWORD_ADMIN` or `PRE_SEED_PASSWORD_USER` before first launch.
Afterwards they are stored in the database in the `user` table.

For existing database-auth users, passwords and role assignments can be repaired with the operational CLI. See [User Management](/docs/admin/user-management/#operational-cli).

Open `http://<url>:<TARANIS_PORT>/config/sources` and click **load default sources** to import the default sources from: [default_sources.json](https://github.com/taranis-ai/taranis-ai/blob/master/src/core/core/static/default_sources.json)

Or import a source export via the **Import**.
