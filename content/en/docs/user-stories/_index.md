## Topics Dashboard
As an analyst, I require access to a Topics Dashboard feature that displays the most important news topics. This dashboard should prioritize the most frequently occurring tags, offering a snapshot of the prevailing themes and subjects within the collected news items. 

## Search, Filter and Sort
As an analyst, I need the capability to search for news items by entering any text string. To provide a ranked list of results based on the relevance to the search query, enabling me to quickly and effectively identify the most pertinent articles for further analysis. 

## Vote on Story
As an analyst, I want to mark news items as important by voting on them. To allow me to quickly identify and categorize significant articles for easy retrieval at a later time. Each Story includes buttons for down and up voting as well as for marking an story as important. Via a shortcut (ctrl+i) I can mark all selected stories as important.

## Mark as read
As an analyst, I want to mark news items as read to prevent myself and other anlyst from viewing the same story multiple times. Each Story contains a button to mark a story as read or unread if already marked as read. The same behaviour can be toggled via a shortcut (ctrl+space).

## Tags 
As an analyst, I need the ability to filter news items based on tags, attributes, or important keywords. To allow me to quickly find relevant news items by applying a tag filter within the tool. The interface should provide an option to enter or select tags, and display the filtered results. In scenarios where no news items match the selected tags, it should result in an empty story list. 

## Create and edit News Item
As an analyst, I need a feature that enables me to create news items, specifying details such as title, publish date, review, link, article content, and attributes. To maintain data integrity, the editing function will be disabled for any news item once it is included in a report. For ease of use, each news item has an edit button in the Asses view.  

## Manage Report 
As an analyst, I want to create and edit reports directly within the Analyse view. I can create reports from predefined list of report types managed by an administrator. I can edit the metadata of this report, and add Stories to it. I can mark the report as "completed" to allow further processing and publishing.

## Manage Product
As an analyst, I require a feature to create reports directly within the Analyse view. I can create reports from predefined list of report types managed by an administrator. I can edit the metadata of this report, and add Stories to it. I can mark the report as "completed" to allow further processing and publishing.

## Publish Product
As an analyst, I want to publish the findings of a report. So they can be viewed outside of Taranis AI. I can choose only Reports that match my Product type. I can render a preview of the Product before sharing. I can choose the destination where to publish from a predefined list (publishers) managed by an administrator.
