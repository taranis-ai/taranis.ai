Upon logging in, the analyst is greeted by the Dashboard which prominently displays the most significant tags, providing a quick glimpse into the trending topics and themes. This view sets the context for the analyst's tasks ahead.

For efficient work, please review the available hotkeys.

# Assess
For easier filtering, in the user settings consider setting the "End of Shift".
To assess your items, go to the Assess section and set the time filter. Apply the "not read" and "not important" filters. Mark as read any items that have been read but considered as unimportant , then work 
through these items until all are marked as read, only checking summaries. Next, set the filter to "not read" and "important". Verify the importance of each item and mark it 
as read if not important. Check if the item is in an older report and determine if it adds more value; if not, remove "important" and mark as read. Merge items discussing 
the same topic. Update the summary manually or use the "summarize with AI" button. Send important or sector-specific items via email. Optionally, up/down vote items and add 
them to the appropriate reports. Finally, remove the "important" mark and mark as read, or consider using the time filter for better efficiency.

## Additional tasks during assess
During the review process in the Assess tab, the analyst has several tools at their disposal to optimize their workflow:

Voting on Stories: The analyst can vote stories up or down, and mark them as important using buttons or keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+I), to highlight stories of particular relevance.
Mark as Read: To avoid redundancy and ensure efficiency, the analyst can mark stories as read (or unread if needed) with a button or a shortcut (Ctrl+Space).
Tags: By applying tag filters, the analyst can narrow down the selection to the most pertinent articles, enhancing focus and efficiency.
If a story needs editing or creation, the analyst can do so directly within the Assess tab, where each news item can be adjusted until it is locked into a report. This capability is vital for maintaining the freshness and accuracy of the content.

Once the relevant stories are collected and reviewed, the analyst returns to the Analyze tab to finalize the report, marking it as completed. This marks the transition from collection and review to dissemination.

# Analyze
For easier filtering, in the user settings consider setting the "End of Shift".
To analyze your items, go to the Analyze section and review them as done in Assess by merging and removing items. Ensure everything is ready for a final review. Add news items to the appropriate categories, save, and mark the process as completed.

# Publish
Finally, the Publish tab is where the compiled report transforms into a product ready for external consumption. The analyst chooses a product type that fits the report, reviews the final product via a rendered preview, and selects a publication destination from a managed list. This final step disseminates the insights gathered and analyzed, extending the impact of the analystâ€™s work beyond the confines of Taranis AI.
