## 1. Create OSINT Sources

- Import/Export: Sources can be imported and exported as JSON
- CRUD: Sources can be created, updated and deleted. For each source a collector, feed URL and the content location can be defined among other things.

_Note: So far we have used an RSS collector with following sources: [Initial setup](/documentation/deployment/#initial-setup-)_

## 3. Adapt word list's functionality

Word lists can have the following functionalities (displayed under "usage"):

- Collector Includelist: Collected news items using words of this word list will be accepted
- Collector Excludelist: Collected news items using words of this word list will not be accepted
- Tagging Bot: Collected news items will be tagged with words from these word lists
- Collector Includelist & Tagging Bot: A word list can be used for tagging and include listing

## 4. Enable include/exclude list filtering

To activate include or exclude lists, they need to be added to the default source group.

It has to be mentioned, that this include/exclude filtering happens during the news item collection. Therefore, only filtered news items will be stored in the database and displayed in "Assess".

## 5. Bot selection

After the collection, it is possible to adapt news items.

Therefore, following bots are currently available:

- Wordlist bot: Tags news items by wordlist
- IOC bot: Finds indicators of compromise in news items
- NLP tagging bot: Tags news items via NLP
- Story bot: Applies story clustering to news items
- Summary bot: Summarizes stories

CRUD: Bots can be created, updated and deleted.

Index: Decides the order of bots

RUN_AFTER_COLLECTOR: Indicates if bot is active after collection
