## Description
Admin users can manage report types (in the Administration tab). Each report type can have different attribute groups. To those groups various attributes (Text Area, Date, TLP, CPE, etc.) can be added. Attributes can be managed in Administration/Attributes. 
When creating new Reports, one of the created report types have to be selected (see [Analyze](/documentation/analyze)).

### Attributes 
Desired attributes need to be created first. Then they can be managed by the admin user. Besides name, description and default value also type, validator and validator parameter can be set.
