## Description
Product Types facilitate the publication of products capable of aggregating multiple report items. While there are several prebuilt product types available, users also have the option to create their own product types using custom templates.

## Prebuilt Product Types
- CERT Daily Report
- Default HTML Presenter
- Default MISP Presenter
- Default PDF Presenter
- Default TEXT Presenter

## Editing Product Types
All crucial fields are editable, with the most important being Type, Template, and Report Types.

- Type: It's the responsibility of the administrator to ensure the selected type is compatible with the subsequently provided template.
- Template: Users can select from prebuilt templates or add new ones.
- Report Types: This field determines which types of reports can be added to the products.

## Create new Product Types
It can be beneficial to create custom Product Types to meet desired results with the publishers.
### Example of creating a simple new template using Jinja2
This is an example to render arbitrary values and loop over attributes.
1. Create a new file with a unique name in `src/core/core/static/presenter_templates`,
2. Write a custom template:
    ```python
    TITLE: {{ data.report_items[0].get('title') | default('No title provided', true) }}<br>
    DATE CREATED: {{ data.report_items[0].get('created') | default('Not available', true) }}<br>
    LAST UPDATED: {{ data.report_items[0].get('last_updated') | default('Not available', true) }}<br>
    {% for name, attribute in data.report_items[0].get('attributes').items() %}
    {{ name }}: {{ attribute }}<br>
    {% endfor %}
    ```
_Note: If one is interested in creating own templates, it is a good to start to render the object `{{ data }}` first, to understand how to parse the object properly._
3. Restart the Taranis AI instance.

_Note: It is also possible to copy `src/core/core/static/presenter_templates/<new-custom-template.txt>` to a dynamic folder `src/core/taranis_data/presenter_templates` so the restart is not necessary._
